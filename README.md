#ANSP Entomology Digization Resources
Vaughn M. Shirey - 7/27/2016

Repository for ANSP Entomology database. Intended for use by lab volunteers and co-op students entering data for Entomology and a reference for DwC terms and workflows.

### Helpful Links 
With a collection as large as ours, you will likely run into many questions about digitization best practices, data standards, and general database issues. I've included a small reference library of links below to help you navigate some commonplace issues regarding specimen digitization.

### About Databases
Surprisingly, many researchers rely on software such as Microsoft Excel to manage and store information about collecting events. This is a bad practice as Excel files can become corrupted, be accidentally deleted, and a generally prone to data entry mistakes. Additionally data in an Excel sheet is very "flat" this means that although you may be able to relate something as a row or column there is nothing tying each field together - you can easily move data around from column to column or row to row - intentionally, or accidentally. 

Our specimen database runs from a package known as Symbiota, a database system used by many other institutions. More technically, it has either a mySQL or MariaDB DDL/DML backbone with HTML, JavaScript, and PHP interacting to construct a front end for users. For data entry purposes, you don't have to worry about any of that.
