Repository for ANSP Entomology co-op related materials, guides, and other useful information.

Introduction

  > Welcome to your co-op at The Academy of Natural Sciences at Drexel University! I hope you find working in the Entomology   Department a rewarding and informative experience. The people around you are full of knowledge about the world of arthropods, and the historical collection of approx. 2 million specimens is the oldest in North America. 
  
  > My name is Vaughn Shirey and I, like you, was a co-op in the department. I started a databasing initiative in 2014 called the Franklin Parker Preserve database using a platform known as Symbiota. Since then, the department has been working to catalog the specimen level data for the collection on our Symbiota instance. With a collection of about 2 million specimens, we've estimated that if a single person were to input 200 specimen level records a day, databasing the entire collection would take about 58 years! For this reason, we've decided to database on a "special" collection routine.
  
  > The "special" collection workflow is design to highlight our collection strenghths and historical identity by selecting specimen sets with unique characteristics (ie. Philadelphia Insect Collection, Crane Fly Database, etc.) This workflow attempts to make our sizeable collection digestable in the data entry sense, but don't worry - your entire co-op won't be plugging data into a spreadsheet! 
  
  > With this in mind, we hope you will explore the Symbiota platform and develop additional modules/keys/ideas for future implementation. I encourage you to explore your skill set and create a unique project for yourself during your 6-months here. Below you will find useful links and material that you should (must) read to be successful at this co-op. Good luck and have fun!
